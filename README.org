* Lassie

Naturalizing theorem prover tactic languages

** Dependencies

To run Lassie you need to have a working HOL4 installation.
For this please refer to [https://github.com/HOL-Theorem-Prover/HOL].

To compile and run SEMPRE you need to have a working ruby installation.
The java `jar` command should also be available either from OpenJDK or Oracle Java.

Lassie additionally depends on the following shell variables:
  `LASSIEDIR` which must point to the folder where Lassie is stored (i.e. this directory)

** Setup

To run Lassie you need to first configure some environment variables:
#+NAME:lassie_vars
#+BEGIN_SRC bash :results silent
export LASSIEDIR=`pwd`
echo "export LASSIEDIR=$LASSIEDIR" >> ~/.bash_profile
#+END_SRC

Now you can set up SEMPRE and build the Lassie support library

#+NAME:setup_sempre
#+BEGIN_SRC bash :results silent
cd $LASSIEDIR/sempre/
./pull-dependencies core interactive
ant core interactive
cd $LASSIEDIR/src
$HOLDIR/bin/Holmake
#+END_SRC

Now you should be able to run Lassie by invoking the `run` script: `$LASSIEDIR/sempre/interactive/run @mode=lassie`
