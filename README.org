* Lassie

Naturalizing theorem prover tactic languages

** Dependencies

To run Lassie you need to have a working HOL4 installation.
For this please refer to [https://github.com/HOL-Theorem-Prover/HOL].

Lassie additionally depends on the following shell variables:
  `POLYDIR` which must point to the polyml installation folder (e.g. ~/git/polyml)
  `LASSIEDIR` which must point to the folder where Lassie is stored (i.e. this directory)

#+BEGIN_SRC bash :results silent
#+END_SRC

** Setup

First you need to set up SEMPRE:

#+NAME:setup_sempre
#+BEGIN_SRC bash :results silent
export LASSIEDIR=~/Projects/Lassie/
export POLYDIR=~/Git_Repos/polyml/
cd $LASSIEDIR/sempre/
./pull-dependencies core interactive
ant core interactive
#+END_SRC

Now you should be able to run Lassie by invoking the `run` script: `$LASSIEDIR/sempre/interactive/run @mode=lassie`
